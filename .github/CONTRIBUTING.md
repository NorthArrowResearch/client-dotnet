Contributing to the GeoOptix .NET Client
========================================

## Reporting issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written bug report and will thank 
you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/geooptix/client-dotnet/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

## Contributions

We're not accepting pull requests until we have a sensible contribution policy 
and guideline docs in place. We're working on it - please stay tuned!
